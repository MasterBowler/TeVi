      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report contains an elaborate description of the functionality offered by <a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/" target="_blank">TeVi</a>, a global terrorism visualiser
        which focuses on showing reliable statistics and location services regarding the worldwide terrorism, both of them
        having advanced filtering options. The site also contains some useful information about prevention measures and 
        the worldwide evolution of terrorism and a contact form to facilitate communication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="motivation">

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        We chose this project because of its link with real life events and the probability for it to be useful:
        Terrorism is a worldwide problem widely covered in the media and it is an interesting matter to see
        where, when, how and why these attacks happened, as many people would like to see exactly the impact
        it has.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Technologies used">
      <h2>Used Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The project was implemented using HTML for markup, SCSS to ease most of the frontend part of the implementation, CSS,
        JavaScript ES5 and ES6 and ChartJS for the functionality and PHP 7.3 for the backend part. The database was accessed using 
        MySQL queries.
      </p>
      <p>The Design was made in Photoshop CC2019 by Elisa Giurgea, who works as a designer for Stempora, as we deemed for a 
        pixel perfect interface to be important in showcasing the content of the site nicely.
      </p>

      <h2>Functionality</h2>

      <section id="Frontend">
        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>For the frontend part we aspired to get a clean, fully responsive interface to provide the user with an experience
          as close to flawless as possible.
        </p>
        <img src="img/home.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="img/text page.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="img/team.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="img/contact.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
        <p>Based on the PSDs, we created an intuitive markup for each page:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/">Global Statistics</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/evolution.html">Evolution</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/prevention.html">Prevention Measures</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/team.html">Who are we</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://tevi.stempora.me/contact.html">Contact</a></li>
          </ul>
          which was later stylized using SCSS, which is a 
          combination between JS and CSS which facilitates using variables, functions and mixins to ease and standardize the 
          work behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsive part was inspired by the Bootstrap system of columns, but implemented by us in a simplified form.
          We chose to go with this method to standardize the way the pages act on different resolutions easier.
        </p>
        <img src="img/responsive.png" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
        <p>Apart from the columns system, we deemed fit to implement a collapsed menu on responsive as the classic top
          navigation bar doesn't look mobile friendly and it is far easier to navigate the site on your phone when you 
          have this type of menu.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, we treated several breaking points to make the content look optimal for the user. For example, the fonts and buttons
          might look good on a FullHD resolution, but having huge fonts on mobile is tiring and unesthetic.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="Backend">
        <h3>Backend and Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          TeVi has 3 main points when it comes to backend and functionality: to filter, to locate and to provide statistics. 
        </p> 

        <section id="Filtering">
          <!-- review? -->
          <h4>Filtering the attacks</h4>
          <p>
            The provided CSV on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd">https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd</a> 
            has 155.27 MB, 135 columns with fields specific to each of the 180.000 attacks so it seems only logical to 
            implement a filtering system based on a few options:
            <ul>
              <li>What happened to the vitims of the attack? Was it a fatal attack or not, did the perpetator commit suicide? - DYNAMIC FILTER</li>
              <li>In what period of time did the attack happen? - STATIC FILTER</li>
              <li>What was the attack related to? - DYNAMIC FILTER</li>
              <li>What weapon was used for the attack? - DYNAMIC FILTER</li>
              <li>In what region and country did it happen? - DYNAMIC FILTER</li>
            </ul>
          </P>
          <p>
            Using these advanced search filters the application returns only the attacks which fit the option chosen by
            user and the user will be able to see the statistics and the map only with a certain type of attacks. If none
            of the filters are selected the map and charts view will consist of all the attacks imported.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we mentioned above, initially all the events are taken into consideration.
          </p>
          <img src="img/initial filters.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="img/before.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:">
          <p>
            After applying some filters, only the events which fit will be displayed.
          </p>
          <img src="img/applied filters.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="img/after.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            The filtering was implemented using PHP and JavaScript. The necessary field values were imported dynamically from the database
            using queries and they were later used to classify the events into groups which share similar values for the fields used to filter them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Location">
          <!-- review? -->
          <h4>Locating the attacks</h4>
          <p>
            Using the Google Maps API we used the map plugin to show the terrorist attacks on the map. The events shown are affected
            by the filters.
          </P>
          <p>
            The attacks were "placed" on the map according to the data in the latitude and longitude fields in the CSV provided by Kaggle.
          </p>
          <img src="img/map.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            The map has the usual Google Maps functionality: Regular View, Street View, zooming option, fullscreen view option, and the 
            possibility to get the current location of the user in order to show him the closest attacks that happened. The current location
            only works on https, but if the user is on http he will get an alert which informs him that he should use https to use the 
            browser location function.
          </p>
          <img src="img/alert map.png" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            Clicking on a marker on the map automatically opens up a popup with general information about the attacks which happened
            on the exact location.
          </p>
          <img src="img/opened event.png" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            When the user clicks on the marker, a request is sent to the server to return the values in the following fields which show
            the country and the city where the attack happened, the group which committed the attack, the number of deaths and wounded people, 
            the weapon used for the attack and the summary. Also, the user has the possibility to search for more information about the weapon
            on Wikipedia and Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            If more than one event happened at the same location, all the events that happened there will be shown.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the CSV, there are several events which don't have a value in the longitude and latitude fields and instead of showing
           them on the map at the (0,0) coordinates, they are removed from the map.
          </p>
          
        </section>

        <section id="Statistics">
          <!-- review? -->
          <h4>Providing Statistics</h4>
          <p>
            The statistics for the terrorist attacks were created using ChartJs, a free open source library for data visualization, which supports
            several chart types.
          </p>
          <img src="img/graphs.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            To showcase the variations we chose to use 4 different charts based on different fields which are relevant
            to showcasing data related to terrorism.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <img src="img/graph1.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px">
              The chart showcasing terrorism by regions has the number of victims on the Y axis and the regions on the X axis. The fields used for
              this stacked bar chart are nkill, nwound, region and region_txt.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="img/graph2.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px">
              The chart showcasing the terrorist incidents which happened in a certain period of time
               has the number of victims on the Y axis and the years on the X axis. The fields used for
              this line chart are nkill, nwound and iyear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="img/chart3.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px">
              The chart showcasing the most attacked targets has the number of victims on the Y axis and the targerts on the X axis. The fields used for
              this line chart are nkill, nwound, targtype1_txt and targtype1.
            </li>
            <li>
              <img src="img/chart4.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px">
              The chart showcasing the attack types has the attacks shown in percentages according to the number of victims. The fields used for
              this pie chart are nkill, nwound, attacktype1 and attacktype1_txt.
            </li>

          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Similarly to the map, the data for the charts is affected by the filters in order to show the varying statistics in different situations
            where terrorism happened.
          </p>

          <h4>Exporting Statistics</h4>
          <p>
            For each chart the user can export in 3 different formats: the normal graphs in PNG or SVG format (because of the big number of values in 
            ceratin fields, which caused the text to intercalate we gave the SVG a bigger height) or a CSV with the fields and the values
            used for the chart.
          </p>
          <img src="img/download chart.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="img/export png.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
          <p>
            When the user clicks on a button to download a chart, a request is sent to the server to do it. 
          </p>

     <section id="Optional page">
      <h2>Optional pages</h2>
      <p>
        Because the projects is to create a site, we thought that incorporating more page would be a great idea, as the user would get more
        opportunities to interact with the site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the main page with the filters, map and statistics, we implemented 4 more pages. 
      </p>

      <section id="Contact Page">
        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <p>
          In the contact page we included a contact form and some useful information about the database.

        <img src="img/contact.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;">

        <section id="Form">
          <h2>The message form</h2>
          <p>
            The Send Us a Message form has several input fields: First Name, Last Name, University, Class, Email and Message. The input is sent to the 
            server. The input is verified.
          </p>
          <img src="img/form1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;">

          <p>
            The user has to type a valid input in order to be able to send a message. If this isn't done properly, error messages will be displayed.
          </p>
